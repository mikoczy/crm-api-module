# CRM API Module

This documentation serves as a complement to [CRM Skeleton](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-skeleton/#registerapicalls)
documentation related to creating and registering API handlers.

It describes API handlers provided by this module for others to use.

## Enabling module

Make sure you add extension to your `app/config/config.neon` file.

```neon
extensions:
	- Crm\ApiModule\DI\ApiModuleExtension
```

### Configuration

Module allows you to configure preflight request handling. Add following snippet to your `config.neon` file:

```neon
services:
	# ...
	apiHeadersConfig:
		setup:
			- setAllowedOrigins('*')
			- setAllowedHeaders('Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With')
			- setAllowedHttpMethods('*')
```

You can configure allowed origins by explicitly stating them or by using wildcards. Following configurations are valid:

- `setAllowedOrigins("*")`. Matches everything
- `setAllowedOrigins("foo.bar", "*.foo.bar")`. Matches `foo.bar` and all of its subdomains.
- `setAllowedOrigins("foo.bar", "1.foo.bar")`. Matches `foo.bar`, `1.foo.bar`, but nothing else (nor any other subdomain).

#### Data retention configuration

You can configure time before which `application:cleanup` deletes old repository data and column which it uses by using (in your project configuration file):

```neon
apiLogsRepository:
	setup:
		- setRetentionThreshold('-2 months', 'created_at')
```

## API documentation

All examples use `http://crm.press` as a base domain. Please change the host to the one you use
before executing the examples.

All examples use `XXX` as a default value for authorization token, please replace it with the
real tokens:

* *API tokens.* Standard API keys for server-server communication. It identifies the calling application as a whole.
They can be generated in CRM Admin (`/api/api-tokens-admin/`) and each API key has to be whitelisted to access
specific API endpoints. By default the API key has access to no endpoint. 
* *User tokens.* Generated for each user during the login process, token identify single user when communicating between
different parts of the system. The token can be read:
    * From `n_token` cookie if the user was logged in via CRM.
    * From the response of [`/api/v1/users/login` endpoint](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-users-module#post-apiv1userslogin) -
    you're free to store the response into your own cookie/local storage/session.

API responses can contain following HTTP codes:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 OK | Successful response, default value | 
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request (missing required parameters) | 
| 403 Forbidden | The authorization failed (provided token was not valid) | 
| 404 Not found | Referenced resource wasn't found | 

If possible, the response includes `application/json` encoded payload with message explaining
the error further.
